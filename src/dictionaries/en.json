        "p1": "Shiatsu consists of applying rhythmic pressure throughout the body for the purpose of bodily rebalancing and improving or maintaining health. This manual technique mainly uses the thumbs and palms of the hands, but also sometimes the elbows or knees to exert pressure on precise points (tsubos) located along energy meridians."

        "heading": "Historical Roots",

Over the centuries, Japanese practitioners developed their own approach, giving birth to anma massage. The term 'shiatsu' itself was chosen in 1919 by Tenpeki Tamaï, but it is Tokujiro Namikoshi (1905-2000) who is considered the inventor of modern shiatsu, thanks to his founding experience where he healed his mother's rheumatism through finger pressure."

        "p1": "Shiatsu considers the human being in their physical, psychological and mental totality. It is based on the concept of circulation of vital energy (called Qi in Chinese and Ki in Japanese) through energy channels called meridians. According to this philosophy, any imbalance results from a blockage in this energy circulation."

His revolutionary approach emerged from a significant personal experience during his childhood. At age 7, after the family moved to Hokkaido island, his mother developed severe joint rheumatism due to the harsh climate change. Young Tokujiro empirically discovered that 'pressure' with his fingers was more beneficial than traditional friction for relieving her. His mother's health improved considerably, and she lived to 88 years old."
