Over the centuries, Japanese practitioners developed their own approach, giving rise to the anma massage. The term 'shiatsu' itself was chosen in 1919 by Tenpeki Tamaï, but it is Tokujiro Namikoshi (1905-2000) who is considered the inventor of modern shiatsu, thanks to his foundational experience of healing his mother's rheumatism with finger pressure."
